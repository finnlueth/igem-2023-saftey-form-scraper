4455,ASU,"Our project aims to engineer the microalga C. reinhardtii to be able to bioaccumulate arsenic in the hopes that it can act as a biological filter to filter contaminated groundwater. To do this, we will transform two genes into the C. reinhardtii nucleus: phytochelatin synthase (PCS) and arsenate reductase (ARR2p). Phytochelatins are naturally-occuring proteins in many plants, including C. reinhardtii, that bind to heavy metals in the environment and transport them to the cellÃ¢ÂÂs vacuole. By expressing an additional PCS gene, C. reinhardtii will be able to sequester more arsenic. However, phytochelatins can only form complexes with arsenite, but arsenite and arsenate both exist in water sources. Thus, the ARR2p gene is needed to reduce all arsenate ions to arsenite before they can bind to phytochelatins and be stored in the vacuole."
4294,Athens,"Inspired by Computer Science, we aim to build a biological analogue of a ""perceptron"", an algorithm that plays the role of a linear classifier and comprises the fundamental structural and functional unit of an artificial neural network. To achieve that, we plan to genetically engineer two separate E.coli populations, known as ""layers"" in Computer Science. The first population, the sender cells, will be further divided into three subpopulations, each recognizing atc (anhydrotetracycline) as a chemical input at a different level or ""weight"", as is the appropriate term. Different weights will be assigned by incorporating different RBS (ribosome binding site) sequences into each subpopulation's main construct. Thus, each sender subpopulation will be induced to produce OC6, a quorum sensing molecule, at a different extent. Given that cross-talk among different sender subpopulations will be confined, the total sum of the quorum sensing signal will then stimulate the second population, the receiver cells, to produce a binary output (1 or 0 in Computer Science) in the form of (high) fluorescence or lack of fluorescence (low fluorescence) respectively via a steep activation function.In other words, our goal is to realize a cellular communication system with the property of pattern recognition through cellular decision making.We plan to develop our project at a foundational level; however, we hope the system we propose will have future implementations as a novel type of biosensor that displays basal artificial intelligence."

4229,Freiburg,"The production of valuable compounds such as pigments or drugs in bacteria is a more ecologically friendly and sustainable approach compared with chemical synthesis.  Usually, the metabolic pathway required for the biosynthesis of the compound is transplanted from the natural producer into a model bacterium such as Escherichia coli. To improve product yield, it is common practice to increase the expression levels of the exogenous enzymes; however, the right stoichiometry between enzymes in the pathway must be achieved, and this can be tedious and laborious, being mostly based on trial-and-error. Moreover, another common problem is the production of toxic intermediates, which hinder the growth of the host organism, eventually negatively impacting on the final product yield. We plan to utilize bacterial microcompartments in E. coli to increase the yield of the commercially relevant indigo dye and indirubin anti-leukemic drug by sequestering into the compartments two of the enzymes required for their biosynthesis.

Our hypervesiculating bacterial strain will be engineered to display various affinity proteins on the surface of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in order to target specific HER2+ breast cancer cell surface biomarkers: HER2 & C5AR1. The affinity proteins being used are an anti-HER2 affibody and a tumour homing peptide (THP) against C5AR1. These affinity proteins are displayed via genetically fusing them to Cytolysin A (ClyA), a native E.coli protein that naturally translocates to the outer membrane. [Kim, Jae-Young et al 2008, del Castillo FJ, 1997]. This drug delivery system relies on a prodrug-enzyme combination. Two types of OMVs are generated: Type 1 OMVs which express the anti-HER2 affibody on their surface and will be loaded with a prodrug, and Type 2 OMVs which expresses THP against C5AR1 and will be loaded with enzyme/mRNA for an enzyme. Only after both types of OMVs have been successfully simulatenously internalized into a tumor cell can the prodrug and enzyme interact to produce the active drug. This double-check mechanism is analogous to an AND gate and works by ensuring that the drug is activated only in cells that overexpress both markers. This technique is theorized to cause a significant reduction in off-site targeting."

4385,Jilin_China,"Ã¢ÂÂ¢	Our project is based on the biosorption of copper, zinc and lead ions, so as to achieve the purpose of removing heavy metal ions in the environment by E. coli. Based on XL1-Blue E. coli strain, we designed and applied molecular biosensors of zinc and copper ions for biological detection and repair strategies. Two specific two-component systems, known as CusSR and ZraSR, are used to sense environmental changes through multiple signal components and control gene expression in response to changes in signal molecules.Ã¢ÂÂ¢	(1) Zinc and copper ions related system: For effective absorption of zinc and copper ions, we introduced OmpC-CBP and OmpC-ZBP coupling gene. The corresponding promoters are pcusC(copper ions specific promoter) and pzraP(zinc ions specific promoter). OmpC protein is a membrane localization protein that can help external ions transfer into cells. CBP and ZBP protein can bind copper ions and zinc ions respectively. In this way, the extracellular copper ions and zinc ions can be absorbed into the cells through surface display, so as to reduce the solution concentration. The results show that the system is sensitive and effective to sense and treat heavy metal pollution.Ã¢ÂÂ¢	(2)Lead ion related system: The pbr operon is selected to construct the induction system, and Lpp-OmpA is applied in the surface display process to adsorb lead ions. The system can detect the concentration of lead ions in the environment through pbr operon and pbrR protein."

4139,Lethbridge,"The goal of our project is to combat the issues caused by bloom-forming cyanobacteria using a synthetic biological system. This will involve developing our proof-of-concept in the laboratory, then moving testing in a mesocosm or lake testing facility to replicate natural lake conditions and assess potential environmental or ecological concerns. Firstly, we will utilize laboratory strain organisms (E. coli: DH5a and BL21(DE3)) to test a system involving multiple different biomolecules. Our method of delivery will incorporate a phage-like-particle (MS2 capsid protein and maturation protein A) able to carry our cargos that target different molecules that contribute to the toxic and harmful properties of cyanobacteria. The cargos and their uses will include:The CRISPR-Cas13a endonuclease from L. buccalis that associates with a direct-repeat stem-loop CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) to form the ribonucleoprotein(RNP).The Cas13a protein becomes activated when its crRNA recognizes a complementary mRNA sequence . Upon recognition and subsequent formation of mRNA-crRNA duplex via hydrogen bonding interactions, the two HEPN-domains (HEPN1 and HEPN2) move together to form the catalytic center and allow for activation of the non-specific/collateral RNA cleavage enzyme function (Liu et al. 2017). For our purposes, we take advantage of non-specific cellular mRNA cleavage with the intent of down-regulating important RNA transcripts in cyanobacteria prior to translation; effectively preventing the synthesis of important enzymes involved in synthesis of the cyanotoxin, microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in M. aeruginosa (Tambe et al, 2018; Watanabe et al. 2019). These come from the Mcy gene cluster, and we hypothesize that disrupting their biosynthetic pathway will not only inhibit ability to respond to nutrient depravation conditions in cyanobloom populations and other postulated physiological or competitive roles (Pimentel and Giani 2014; Holland and Kinnear 2017), but also will prevent any new formation of MC-LR toxins to be released in the event of cell lysis. Moreover, the non-specific activity will likely result in cell death or dormancy due to collateral cleavage of cellular mRNAs (East-Seletsky et al. 2017); but this will only occur with toxic microcystin-producing cyanobacteria, ensuring another level of specificity.Lbu-crRNA: An RNA structure from L. buccalis.This RNA structure binds with the Cas13a protein it folds into a direct-repeat stem-loop with the complementary sequence exposed to chosen mRNA target in the cyanobacterial cellular environment. The sequence choice(s) for crRNAs have been shown to be vital in optimizing enzyme functionality (Nalefski et al. 2021). Through experimental testing of multiple different crRNAs produced via in vitro transcription, we seek to optimize the target sequence for the highest efficiency of target recognition and effective Cas13a behaviour. The microcystinase-A (mlrA) enzyme from Sphingomonas sp.This enzyme specifically cleaves at the non-proteinogenic ADDA to Arginine peptide bond of the cyclic hepatotoxin MC-LR in M. aeruginosa, resulting in linearization and significant loss of toxicity. This approach will further reduce risks of MC-LR release upon cell lysis by significantly reducing toxicity (by around 160-fold). In the future, other enzymes from the microcystinase gene cluster can be incorporated to fully eliminate any toxic potential of MC-LRs.

Booming industries and increasing agricultural production further increase the demand for the indispensable resource. As a consequence of climate change, the natural supply of available freshwater will be limited in the future, making it a scarce resource. Not only clean drinking water, but also for water used in agriculture or cooling systems in industry. Therefore, our team decided to focus on bio desalination of sal or brackish water.

PCC 11901 is a robust cyanobacterial strain for high biomass productionÃ¢ÂÂ by Artur WÃÂodarczyk et. al (2020). This strain was selected because it is naturally transformable, has a relatively short doubling time of about 2 hours, grows at high light intensities and in a wide range of salinities. The goal is to develop cyanobacteria that are able to biodesalinate salt or brackish water. For this, a selection of genes (to be determined in the research, but for example bacterial rhodopsin and/or halorhodopsin based) will be cloned into expression plasmids which will then be transformed into the bacteria.

4141,Thessaloniki,"We design a molecular tool for targeted therapy of glioblastoma multiforme. The tool is based on the selective and precise detection of two over-expressed microRNAs in glioblastoma cells and the silencing (siRNAs) of selected mRNAS specific for glioblastoma multiforme. In more detail this molecular tool is loaded into carriers (e.g. liposomes) for specific cancer cell targeting. Since the cancer cells are recognized, the molecular tool is released inside the cells and 2 miRNAs are detected. Only if both biomarkers are detected, the molecular system gets activated through the method of HCR (hybridization chain reaction: an isothermal, signal amplification method using DNA hairpins) and two small interfering RNAs are released. The purpose of these siRNAs is to target and silence overexpressed oncogenic mRNAs causing tumour regression. "
4170,Thessaloniki_Meta,"We design an in vitro diagnostic device for the early detection of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Early-stage lung cancer is mostly asymptomatic, and low-dose spiral CT imaging, the current method for detecting early lung cancer lesions, isn't feasible as a widespread screening test for the general population due to high cost and the radiation hazard of repeated screenings. Our project is about a costless, easy ,fast and non-invasive molecular diagnostic device for detecting serum miRNAs that are overexpressed on Non-Small-Cell-Lung Cancer during the first stages of the disease.  Our project consists of four basic parts.1) Bioinformatic analyzes in order to find the perfect miRNA -biomarker that is overexpressed on patients' blood. 2) The detecting system, which consist of the LbuCas13a protein (works like nuclease), crRNA (guides the protein and binds due to complementarity with the miRNA biomarker)  and fluorescent rna reporter. When the protein detects on the sample the miRNA biomarker, it  begins cleaving the reporter RNA and a light signal is emitted.3)Microfluidic chip. The detection reaction occurs simultaneously on numerous water in oil microemulsions droplets which are produced on a 3D printed microfluidic chip.4) The last part of our project concerns the detection of the emitted light signal by the application of simple imaging algorithms of image resolution and the use of a fluorescence microscope.The tool we design is an in vitro diagnostic tool and it is based on the parts that have been described. More specifically, no microorganisms are required for this diagnostic tool, but genetically engineered microorganisms will be used as cloning hosts and cloning vectors for the in vitro transcription of the crRnas and the improved expression and production of the protein LbuCas13a.  The microorganisms that will be used specifically are: Escherichia Coli DH5a and E. Coli BL21 DE3."
4213,Thessaly,"The goal of our project is to construct a plant whose roots will have the ability to detect the cyanotoxin microcystin-LR and, in response, they will increase the Pi uptake from its environment. To be more specific, the detection of microcystin will be done by a riboswitch that will contain a specific aptamer that recognizes the toxin. Unfortunately, the design of a new functional plant riboswitch is quite uncertain, so we will be also using the well-characterized TPP riboswitch in our experiments. This riboswitch is an OFF-riboswitch and therefore the next part of our system will be the TetR protein, that would be repressed by the riboswitch in the presence of the toxin/TPP and when expressed properly (in the absence of the toxin/TPP), it will repress the expression of the next part of our system which will be a Pi transporter from the PHT1 protein family. This exogenous Pi transporter will increase the Pi uptake by the plantÃ¢ÂÂs roots.In the future, we aim to construct a floating platform placed on the surface of water bodies (also called waterbed) which will contain a certain number of our plants described above. Its purpose will be the bioremediation of eutrophic water ecosystems and therefore the roots of our plants will be in the water where they will remove the extra Pi in the presence of microcystin-LR. As a result, our synthetic plant will enhance the phosphorus uptake, leading to bioremediation of eutrophic water, in a very specific way so that it affects as little as possible the rest of the ecosystem."

These plasmids will be transfected into our HEK293T cells to express and display the synthetic receptor: Generalized Extracellular Molecule Sensor (GEMS). This GEMS platform displayed on the HEK293 cells binds to (auto-)antibodies (anti-PR3 monoclonal igG mouse antibodies) and consequently activates an intracellular signaling pathway (JAK/STAT) to express and excrete IL-10. The IL-10 is anti-inflammatory and therefore able to decrease the inflammation caused by auto-immune diseases and ANCA Associated Vasculitis (AAV) in a specific way. As outlook this concept could be used as a basis for a personalized, responsive cell therapy for autoimmune diseases that only has to be administered once and decreases auto-immune disease associated symptoms. "
4361,TUDelft,"The goal of the project is to develop a protein-based bioelectric sensor for detecting gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). This substance is known as the most common rape drug used by criminals to incapacitate their victims. GHB is psychoactive and a very powerful depressant of the central nervous system, which can cause severe brain/nerve damage when mixed with alcohol. During the last few years, there has been an increase in cases of GHB drugging in the nightlife environment. Existing GHB detection technologies are slow, inconvenient, expensive, and often require a laboratory setting. Our project aims at providing an improved diagnostic method which can facilitate GHB detection.Our detection method is based on using a transcriptional repressor BlcR from Rhizobium radiobacter (formerly Agrobacterium tumefaciens) (PDB: 3MQ0), which binds to its DNA binding sequence and blocks the transcription of the downstream region. GHB acts as an allosteric effector of BlcR, thus modulating its binding to DNA. Upon the presence of GHB, BlcR is released from DNA, which in turn allows transcription of the sequence downstream of the BlcR binding site.Our bioelectric sensor is based on measuring the difference in capacitance induced by the presence of GHB. The interdigitated electrode will have fingers on which DNA strands and BlcR are immobilized. Binding of BlcR onto the DNA displaces water molecules, which translates into a low capacitance signal. When GHB enters the sensor, BlcR unbinds from the DNA strands and diffuses outside of the biological layer, allowing water molecules to enter this layer. This, in its turn, translates into measuring a higher capacitance signal.GHB is classified as a hard drug molecule and is on List I of controlled substances in the Netherlands. As such, working with this substance for research purposes requires an institutional permit, and applying for it is a process that takes time, which would exceed the duration of our entire iGEM project. Considering these requirements, we decided to use safe and legal analogue molecules, which can mimic the allosteric effect of GHB on BlcR, in all of our planned experiments. These analogues have been selected  based on their structural similarity to GHB and/or previously known affinity to BlcR, in consultation with biochemical experts. Only in the final stage of our project we plan, if possible, to characterize the response of our final bioelectric sensor when exposed to GHB. These validation experiments will be conducted in either an academic institution, company or a diagnostic laboratory that has the required legal permit for working with GHB.The goal of our project will be focused on engineering BlcR and its binding DNA sequence in order to optimize key factors affecting the performance of our bioelectric sensor (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, dynamic range and limit of detection).The experimental part of our project is divided into 4 main wet-lab modules:-   In the first module, we aim to produce and characterize native BlcR proteins in order to measure the effect of important external factors (e.g. temperature, pH and ethanol concentrations) on the binding affinity between BlcR and DNA. Additionally, we aim to characterize the interaction between BlcR and GHB analogues, to identify the candidate that shows maximal release of BlcR from its DNA binding site.-   In the second module, we will engineer BlcR using a directed evolution strategy. A rational library of protein mutants will be generated using Site Directed Mutagenesis and screened for enhanced binding.-   In the third module, the BlcR binding sequence will be engineered to optimize the response to the presence of GHB (or an analogue) in terms of sensitivity and dynamic range. This will be achieved by creating DNA sequence variants and characterizing them for improved binding. The aim of this module is to optimize certain design variables (e.g. binding sequence, spacer sequence, and the number of consecutive BlcR binding sites).-  In the fourth module, the bioelectric sensor will be constructed by immobilizing the DNA strands containing the BlcR binding sequence on the electrodes. Based on the outcome from modules 2 and 3, optimal BlcR mutants and/or DNA binding sequences will be used for the construction of this sensor. With this module,  the main parameters affecting the performances of the bioelectric sensor will be fine-tuned.All the experiments of our project will be performed in an ML-I level lab. The plasmids containing BlcR protein will be stored in E. coli DH5Ã°ÂÂÂª cells and purified when required.Complying with iGEMÃ¢ÂÂs Safety and Security Policies, our project will not use any human samples (e.g. saliva, blood or urine) nor perform testing on humans or animals during the development of our bioelectric sensor."

We want to promote the use of this model organism in the iGEM community by developing a yeast shuttle vector for RFC1000 assembly, suitable for expression of heterologous DNA sequences. We also plan to expand the registry of genetic parts available for the iGEM community by screening for high-efficiency signal peptides for the secretion of target proteins. Secretion would allow us to easily purify the desired protein product and avoid introducing GMOs close to the wound environment to stimulate healing.Yeast has several advantages over E. coli. Most importantly, it can perform post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation. We plan to take advantage of these features by creating a system for protein production in yeast, which would allow researchers to obtain proteins in their optimal native structure. The major benefit of our protein secretion system would be a biobrick composed of a SUMO tag fused to a secretion signal peptide. The SUMO tag allows for a 'scar-less' N-Terminus of the expressed protein, after protease cleavage of the purification tag. As a result, the combination of our scar-less protein production system and the signal peptide toolbox would allow for simpler and more efficient high-yield production of bioactive and natively folded proteins."

Pichia pastoris was the selected expression system to execute or express our genetic circuits containing the U1-theraphotoxin-Sp1a and Omega-hexatoxin-Hv2a peptides sequences from the Australian tarantula and spider Selenotypus plumipes and Hadronyche versuta respectively. These peptides interact with the voltage-gated sodium (NaV) and calcium (CaV) channels in the insect's central nervous system, modifying the structure, and disrupting their function, causing the paralysis and death of the insect. The expression of these peptides is controlled by the methanol inducible alcohol oxidase I promoter (pAOX1) from Pichia pastoris. The product of the circuit is a fusion protein of lectin attached to the venom peptide's end. The Snowdrop Lectin from the plant Galanthus nivalis agglutinin works as a carrier to the hemolymph of insects after oral ingestion."

4269,UChicago,"Our team is designing a biosensor to address the pollution of bodies of water with Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA). Currently, the major methodology to detect PFOA in water is to use Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). The necessity for LC-MS means that doing field work studies on the pervasiveness of PFOA is both slow and costly. By creating a biosensor able to fluoresce bright enough for a naked eye to detect, we hope to create a quick and cost efficient solution to allow for more accessible testing. We plan to build upon work done by the U.S. Air Force iGem team in 2019 to engineer R. jostii to express RFP in the presence of PFOAs. Our goal is to get a bright enough RFP signal that the readout is detectable by the naked eye, and we are also interested in determining if RFP levels correlate to the level of PFOAs present. We plan to use a 2-plasmid system; the first plasmid, containing a PFOA-responsive prmA promoter and T7 polymerase gene, will function to produce T7 polymerase in the presence of PFOAs.

4465,UConn,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are exogenous compounds known to cause disruption in the development and fertility of living organisms. These hormonally active agents enter the environment through various mechanisms of air, water, and soil contamination. Natural and synthetic estrogens are some of the most potent endocrine disrupting chemicals found in municipal wastewater and effluent which enters aquatic ecosystems. The synthetic estrogen 17a-ethynylestradiol (EE2), a compound found mainly in contraceptives such as birth control pills, is the most ecotoxic and difficult to degrade due to the presence of a sterically hindering alkyne group. This project aims to use Escherichia coli as a vector for expression and production of a bacterial laccase from Bacillus subtilis that will degrade EE2 at an optimal wastewater pH (6-8). The project seeks to develop recombinant E.coli that is able to withstand wastewater matrix conditions and maintain high activity and increased efficiency.

4444,UPenn,"Our team aims to engineer an optogenetic protein secretion system in mammalian cells.Optogenetics is a technique that allows for precise spatiotemporal control of cellular processes using light responsive protein domains. Upon excitation with light, photoactivatable domains can heterodimerize, homodimerize, photocleave, or cluster. Our approach involves fusing a protein of interest to a photocleavable protein (e.g PhoCl) and a localization tag such as an ER retention signal which arrests the protein secretion pathway at the ER prior to stimulation with light. Upon excitation, the responsive protein cleaves, detaching the location tag and allowing the protein to be secreted through the natural secretion pathway of the cell. Alternatively our system could utilize a photoactivatable protease that catalyzes removal of the localization tag upon excitation. By completing this project, we hope to provide researchers with a modular toolkit to study a vast number of proteins involved in intercellular communication and further our understanding of cell sociology."

We stress outright that our project is not to introduce bioengineered organisms into the soil, but to provide some critical foundational advances that will allow the power of synthetic biology to be applied safely to the soil in the future. When reviewing the the literature, our team determined that there were four areas which present significant challenges to Ã¢ÂÂsoil synthetic biologyÃ¢ÂÂ: (1) metabolic differences between bacteria in the soil versus in a laboratory setting; (2) chassis choice/optimization for soil deployment; (3) development of efficient readout to assess circuit performance in soil; and (4) safety/containment considerations. To tackle each of these problems, we will: (1) conduct controlled laboratory experiments to assess metabolic/gene expression differences between standard laboratory culture conditions and simulated soil conditions; (2) develop a mathematical model to assess whether a bacterial species will survive optimally in a given environment; (3) design and implement a paper-based genetic platform to allow for on-site, accurate measurement of circuit output; and (4) evaluate the effectiveness of genome integration in our bacteria as a safety measure for synthetic biology in soil environments. By answering these questions, we hope to lay the fundamental groundwork that might one day enable researchers to use synthetic biology safely in the soil.We will answer these questions using several proof of concept circuits, which will include a PETase/MHETase degradation system.
