To study the bioleaching process of bringing the rare earth elements from e-waste into solution, we will use the wild-type S1 bacteria Bacillus licheniformis and potentially the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, we would not modify either of them. However, it is yet not clear whether we will experiment with bioleaching or not. We plan on modifying E. coli BL21 to produce five strains of E. coli expressing five different Lanthanide Binding Peptides (LBP). These peptides specifically bind rare earth element ions. Further, we potentially aim to produce two of these LBPs at a larger scale in Pichia pastoris for usage in immobilization. These proteins will possess a specific tag to bind to nanobeads. The nanobeads will be utilised to emulate an adsorption-based biomanufactoring/biorecycling process to specifically extract rare earth elements from a bioleached solution of electronic waste. The nanobeads are used as a stand-in for a surface expression of the rare earth element binding peptides in a filamentous fungus, which we will try to realize simultaneosly in S. cerevisiae. Further, we want to identify new LBPs using phage display. In our hardware project, we will design a bioreactor that is easy to construct and use, specialized for the growth and application of a filamentous fungus potentially usable in small scale biomanufatoring processes as for our envisioned rare earth recycling.

      "['4610', 'CCA-San-Diego', 'Parasites of freshwater finfish exert significant economic damages to the aquaculture industry, being associated with an annual cost of some $1.05 billion to $9.58 billion. Notwithstanding this economic impact, these parasites, being unable to cause notable disease in humans, are often overlooked in the broader effort to develop antiparasitic diagnostics and therapeutics. The salmon industry, being the fastest-growing means of food production worldwide, is particularly impacted by parasitic infection.Among the most economically-damaging parasites of salmonid fishes are the myxozoan parasites Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, which seriously impairs renal function, and Nucleospora salmonis, which causes a leukemia-like condition, both of which can directly lead to mortality (Sakai et al, 2009). Detection methods, although not widely adopted by the aquaculture industry, do exist, although therapeutics without detrimental environmental impacts are few and far between.We aim to produce fumagillin, an antiparasitic natural product that can be exposed to fish either through oral administration (incorporation into feed) or aquatic release into a contained pen. Fumagillin has demonstrated activity against T. bryosalmonae and N. salmonis. It is not commonly used in industrial applications, but it is considered a promising antiparasitic with a biosynthesis pathway of biochemical interest, with the enzymes involved therein having been fully elucidated only within the last decade. Production in a microbial chassis would serve as a promising alternative to industrial synthesis, which can be unwieldy. We are in the process of studying both pathways in depth and, depending on optimal feasibility and product yield, seek to reconstitute the fumagillin pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with serviceable yield from a precursor endogenous to the yeast.

Early breast cancer is mostly asymptomatic, and tissue biopsy technology, as the current method of detecting lesions in early breast cancer, is not suitable as a broad screening test for the general population because of its tissue damage and pain to patients. Therefore, our project is about a simple, rapid, and portable breast cancer early screening system for the detection of differentially expressed miRNAs in the serum of normal people and breast cancer patients. The rationale for our project is as follows: the Cas13a/crRNA system can recognize cancer-specific miRNA molecules through crRNA, thereby activating the RNase activity of the Cas13a enzyme, thereby cleaving reporter RNA molecules in the reaction system. Cancer-specific miRNA molecule expression is then detected by immunocolloidal gold strip and then cleaved reporter RNA molecules. The Cas13a/crRNA system enables the detection of breast cancer-associated miRNA molecules for early breast cancer screening.The tool we designed is an in vitro diagnostic tool that is based on the parts already described. More specifically, this diagnostic tool does not require microbes, but genetically engineered microorganisms will be used as cloning hosts and cloning vectors for in vitro transcription of crRnas and improved expression and production of the protein LwaCas13a.

      "['4684', 'Concordia-Montreal', 'Our project is tackling the issue of late diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer given that 313,000 women are affected by this type of cancer every single year. With this issue in mind, it is important to note that late diagnosis of ovarian cancer is correlated to a worse prognosis (Canadian Cancer Society). It is shown through these studies that the later you get diagnosed for ovarian cancer, the lower your chance of remission. For example, someone diagnosed with stage III ovarian cancer will have a lower remission rate compared to someone diagnosed with stage II ovarian cancer. Given that this type of cancer is internal, it is hard to detect using physical biopsies. Current liquid biopsy methods traditionally test markers for cancer tumor cells (CTCs), which are present once a tumor has already formed. The goal of our project is two-fold. First, we want to create a biosensor that detects two antigens that are biomarkers commonly found concurrently in ovarian cancer stem cells and can be detected in blood samples: CD133 & CD117. The reason we are targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs) is to address the issue of late detection. These are cells that present themselves before cancer tumor cells and are well accepted in the scientific community for their practical use in cancer research.  Our biosensor will be a gold nanoparticle colorimetric immunoassay that is able to detect a low concentration of antigens. It will have 4 possible outputs: negative (no CSCs present), positive for only CD117 (CSCs present but not necessarily specific for ovarian cancer), positive for only CD133 (CSCs present but not necessarily specific for ovarian cancer) or positive for both CD133 and CD117 (indicating the likely presence of ovarian cancer). This will increase the accuracy of detection for ovarian cancer due to the fact that each biomarker by itself can alert the presence of multiple cancers. For example the CD 133 biomarker is found for both ovarian and breast cancer. We will use the SPR properties of the gold nanoparticles to detect the presence of biomarkers, as well as their concentration in the blood plasma. Secondly, following the detection of the biomarkers, we aim to use CAR-T cell therapy to target the specific ovarian cancer stem cells that have been detected in the patientÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s blood plasma. This requires the collection of T cells from the cancer patientÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s blood which are then bioengineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). This is done in the lab using an inactivated viral vector. Our goal is to synthesize a double-target CAR T-cell that will express 1 CAR for each biomarker (CD 133 and CD117) for a total of 2 CARs. Once these CAR T-cells are developed, they can be injected into the patient for targeted treatment. Currently, we are planning on making the biosensor in the lab and modeling the CAR T-cell therapy.

However, the fragmented nature of the available literature motivated us to develop a conclusive model for the degradation pathway.

Velvet disease is a disorder caused by dinoflagellate parasites of the Amyloodinium genus. The parasite can enter the slime coat of a host fish and then dissolves and consumes the host's cells. Fish farmers and pet owners would benefit from having a rapid test that is able to detect low levels of the juvenile parasite before it is able to infect the fish.The biosensor will be engineered to change colour upon binding to a target protein produced by the parasite.

Proteins play vital roles in cell function and diseases can arise when they become structurally defective. Current treatments often have adverse side effects, leading to the exploration of therapeutic proteins as a solution. However, three main challenges hinder their development: stability, cost, and delivery. The team aims to overcome these barriers by utilizing Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS), which are protein complexes found in certain bacteria. By engineering non-pathogenic strains of bacteria to express T3SS and deliver therapeutic proteins, they hope to achieve efficient, inexpensive, and precise protein delivery. The project focuses on nanobodies, small antibody fragments, due to their simplicity and potential applications in diagnostics, research, and therapeutics. The team plans to measure the effectiveness of nanobody delivery through experiments and assays. Their innovative approach not only tackles protein delivery challenges but also contributes to the advancement of T3SS studies.']\n",

In addition, we also use Escherichia coli as the chassis and design relevant gene circuits to product Ã\\x8eÂ±-Olefins and 10-hydroxydecanoic acid which are two middle chain fatty acid derivatives with high added value.

Additionally, mass production of these chemical assays may give rise to new environmental issues.In response to this challenge, we are committed to developing new DNA-damage reporter systems with embedded destruction mechanisms. These innovative systems aim to address the limitations associated with traditional cell-based assays and offer a more sustainable and effective approach to toxicity detection.In the proposed engineered system, we have integrated three key components:1) Recombinant E. coli: Our engineered E. coli strain is designed to detect DNA damage by activating the RecA promoter. RecA plays a central role in the SOS response and the homologous recombination-based DNA repair system.2) Human cell line (HEK293) Eukaryotic FRET system: Utilizing the binding interaction between ATRIP and RPA in the DNA damage and repair system, our system based on HEK293 cells allows us to observe DNA breaks in vivo. This provides us with an opportunity to study and analyze the dynamics of DNA damage and repair processes.3) Biofilm reduction with hha-transformed E. coli: To mitigate contamination concerns, our recombinant E. coli is transformed with hha, which acts as a biofilm reducer. This allows us to remove bacterial biofilms, enhancing bio-safety. Consequently, the detection process can be carried out with less intensive UV light, further ensuring the overall safety of the system.By incorporating self-destruction mechanisms into our DNA-damage reporter system, we aim to create a more efficient and environmentally conscious solution.

Selection pressure has led to a very strong affinity for gram-positive PAMPs, while other PAMPs and especially Zymosan are recognized rather poorly, compromising the trans-generational priming. We are trying to achieve an improved affinity via both rational design and directed evolution to enable trans-generational immune priming against a wider range of pathogens.To show that our protein improvements could improve trans-generational priming, we need to verify several important aspects of the proteins function. First is the improved binding of the PAMP. Only a significant improvement of PAMP-affinity would justify experiments with live animals. The next step is to check if the protein still gets correctly incorporated into the eggs after the changes we made to it. Improved binding would loose all purpose if the protein and the bound PAMPs cannot be transported into the eggs. We are compelled to use a living queen for this step as no in vitro or in silico system can emulate the formation of the eggs in the queens body and the incorporation of the Vitellogenin.We would then check for the correct incorporation of the PAMPs via cLSM using fluorescently labeled pathogens.

      "['4662', 'UZurich', 'Overview:In this project, we propose to engineer a helper bacterium that conditionally overproduces lactic acid during dysbiosis to re-establish the conditions favored by Lactobacillus crispatus.In a first step, we plan to introduce the Rhl quorum sensing (QS) system into E. coli, allowing it to detect its own population density. Dysbiotic conditions favor the growth of E. coli leading to an increase of population density. Upon reaching a threshold population level, E. coli should redirect its metabolic flux into lactate production, thereby lowering the pH of the vaginal tract. This should allow Lactobacillus crispatus to propel itself into a dominant abundance, due to its ability to outcompete other bacteria strains at low pH levels. Flux redirectioning is achieved by several gRNAs and dCas9 that block the heterofermentative pathways usually active in E. coli. The dCas9 protein is conditionally expressed under the control of the Rhl QS promoter, while the gRNAs are constitutively produced. Additionally a lactate dehydrogenase from Streptococcus bovis will be conditionally overexpressed to further boost the production of lactate.Technical details:Our project can be divided into the following sections: 1.)   Co-Culture of wild type bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Pseudomonas viridiflava, E. coli, Lactobacillus crispatus): Co-culturing is performed in a plate reader to screen multiple conditions such as various pH values and media compositions. The bacteria population is quantified either with optical density values or fluorescent output. This step is conducted to observe if Lactobacillus crispatus can outcompete other bacterial species in a low pH environment due to high abundance of lactate.Lactate tolerance will be tested in media with different lactate content. 2.)   Measuring quorum sensing activityWe will prepare a dilution series for C4-HSL and add the solution after transforming our bacteria to sense and react to this molecule (promoter and transcription factor). We want to check at which concentration our gene transcription is triggered to confirm the sensitivity of our RHL sensing system. First, the gene expressed will be GFP to have a quick optical output. In the next step we take the same plasmid and exchange GFP with Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In a next step we transform the bacteria with a plasmid that contains the gene for C4-HSL production (RhlI) in addition to the promoter and transcription factor used for sensing. We will grow E. Coli, to check if enough C4-HSL can be produced to trigger GFP/LDH production. We might integrate the transcription factor and Rhl I (C4-HSL producing enzyme) chromosomally if we have time. 3.)  To further increase lactate poduction we use dCAS9 to knock down enzymes that use pyruvate as substrate, thereby increasing substrate availability for Lactate dehydrogenase. Potential enzymes to knock down are: PEP carboxylase, phosphoenol synthase, Lactate dehydrogenase (D-Lactate) / Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, Pyruvate formate lyase, Pyruvate dehydrogenase, Pyruvate oxidase, Phosphotransacetylase, Acetate kinase, Alcohol dehydrogenase and Fumarate Reductase.The exact plasmids are not designed yet, but we will use two of the following antibiotic resistances for double transformation: Kanamycin, Chloramphenicol, Gentamicin Spectinomycin, Ampicillin4.)   Co-culture of transformed bacteria againThe engineered E. coli strain should produce lactic acid, changing the conditions in favor of Lactobacillus crispatus. The secreted lactic acid from E. coli will lead to a lower pH in the environment. By co-culturing in different pH environments, the effect of competition related to pH can be observed. Metabolomics analysis:HPLC-MS: Cells will be lysed. Using HPLC-MS we hope to quantify how much pyruvate and lactate is present in the cells at different transformation steps.We hypothesize to see almost no increase in lactate production when only over expressing LDH. However, when adding dCAS9 and silencing genes to redirect the flux accordingly, we hope to see a definite increase in lactate production. Pyruvate levels should stay the same. 5.) Nice to have: If we manage to achieve the points above we would like to expand our system by giving the \"helper bacterium\" a competitive advantage against its WT counterparts. We might insert a resistance gene to E. Coli. The resistance will be against one of Lactobacillus crispatus bacteriocins.

It cannot be assumed that systems that behave well in the lab will behave similarly in the target-deployment site, and synthetic biology must take major strides to begin to bridge this gap.  Our 2023 iGEM project seeks to move towards successful implementation of bioengineered organisms into their target-deployment sites, with an emphasis on soil synbio.  We will do this by addressing two major challenges:  (1) the differential metabolism of bacteria in the lab compared to in the soil and (2) the presence of other (often antagonistic) organisms and viruses (ie. bacteriophages) in the soil.Both of these foundational problems can be addressed by utilizing chassis that are already fit to the environment, such as soil microbes, as opposed to model chassis such as Escherichia coli.  We will do this two ways.  First, we will develop Mycobacterium smegmatis as a novel soil chassis through the production of a promoter library, due to M. smegmatisÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s ubiquity in the soil.

This will actually protect bacteria carrying our gene from infection by other, potentially lytic, phages in the environment.  This system will be tested utilizing phage that infect Mycobacterium smegmatis and compared against both traditional DNA-delivery methods (plasmids, genome integration) with two different proofs of concept:  a control cassette expressing mCherry (a fluorescent protein) and a PAH-degradation system (which can degrade Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, a common soil pollutant).

At the same time, the pKD46 plasmid will be transformed into BL21(DE3) and MC4100 strains to carry out CsgB and A knockout of genomic DNA to obtain improved strains that can express our desired proteins. Subsequently, we introduced pET-21d and pGEX-6p-1 containing the target gene intoBL21(DE3) and MC4100, respectively, to express the CsgA-MBP3 fusion protein. Since there is no CsgB in the genome of the two strains, the Curli fiber encoded by CsgA will not be anchored on the bacterial cell membrane and thus will be produced in large quantities in the matrix.

Fortunately, the CRISPR-Cas system can be used as a therapeutic strategy to eliminate drug-resistant microorganisms due to its high target DNA specificity and convenient programmability. However, when CRISPR-Cas is used for microbial genome editing, there are generally cells ( escapers ) that have not undergone expected editing, which will reduce the editing efficiency of CRISPR-Cas for single genes. Therefore, this topic adopts the.']\n",
